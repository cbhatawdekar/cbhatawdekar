### Hi, I'm Chinmay 👋

![MySign](https://github.com/cbhatawdekar/cbhatawdekar/assets/12450888/060abdce-e3d1-4e10-b523-38c9c4e95051)

If not yet clear from the above , my mantra is to “Keep it simple and automate everything.” By prioritizing automation, I streamline processes and mitigate the potential for human error. Nonetheless, should human error occur, I derive great satisfaction from troubleshooting and resolving issues, especially those that have proven challenging for other engineers. My out-of-the-box thinking often leads me to unconventional yet effective solutions, which leaves me with a deep sense of satisfaction that's hard to put into words.

My love for automation extends beyond my professional work and intersects with my personal hobbies. I've converted 70% of my home into a smart home and I'm constantly expanding on this initiative. Additionally, I'm passionate about coding and often work on pet projects. Lately, I've been exploring the world of drone programming.
