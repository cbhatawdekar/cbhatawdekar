### Hi, I'm Chinmay 👋

If not yet clear from the above , my mantra is to “Keep it simple and automate everything.” By prioritizing automation, I streamline processes and mitigate the potential for human error. Nonetheless, should human error occur, I derive great satisfaction from troubleshooting and resolving issues, especially those that have proven challenging for other engineers. My out-of-the-box thinking often leads me to unconventional yet effective solutions, which leaves me with a deep sense of satisfaction that's hard to put into words.
